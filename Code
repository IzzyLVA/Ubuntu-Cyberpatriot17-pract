## Resolved Vulnerabilities and Solutions

### 1. Forensics Question 1 *(8 pts)*
- **Issue**: Decode a base64 message and locate a deleted file in the Trash.
- **Solution**: Use an online base64 decoder to reveal the message. Navigate to the Trash folder and open the file `l.jpg`.
- **Answer**: `lion`
- **Importance**: Understanding basic encoding techniques and familiarity with file recovery methods.

### 2. Forensics Question 2 *(8 pts)*
- **Issue**: Find the directory containing prohibited MP3 files.
- **Solution**: Use `locate '*.mp3'` in the terminal to identify the directory. Remove the files from the specified directory.
- **Importance**: Efficient file searches help address security issues like prohibited files.

### 3. Remove Unauthorized User *(eli – 6 pts)*
- **Issue**: Unauthorized user accounts exist on the system.
- **Solution**: Access **Settings > Users**, unlock, and remove the user account. Delete associated files.
- **Importance**: Limits access and minimizes attack surfaces.

### 4. Demote Unauthorized Admin *(cornelius – 6 pts)*
- **Issue**: An unauthorized user has administrator access.
- **Solution**: Navigate to **Settings > Users**, unlock, and toggle off `Administrator` access.
- **Importance**: Restricts critical system modifications to authorized users.

### 5. Strengthen Weak Password *(alice – 6 pts)*
- **Issue**: User account has an insecure password.
- **Solution**: Change the password to meet security standards via **Settings > Users**.
- **Importance**: Reduces the risk of password-cracking attacks.

### 6. Add User to Group *(mariya – 7 pts)*
- **Issue**: A required user-group configuration is missing.
- **Solution**: Run `sudo gpasswd -a mariya pioneers` in the terminal.
- **Importance**: Ensures proper access control and supports operational requirements.

### 7. Enforce Minimum Password Length *(4 pts)*
- **Issue**: No password length policy is enforced.
- **Solution**: Edit `/etc/pam.d/common-password` to include `minlen=8`.
- **Importance**: Prevents weak passwords and enhances account security.

### 8. Disable Null Password Authentication *(6 pts)*
- **Issue**: Empty passwords allow authentication.
- **Solution**: Edit `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` to remove `nullok`.
- **Importance**: Blocks unauthorized access through empty passwords.

### 9. Enable UFW Protection *(6 pts)*
- **Issue**: Host-based firewall is disabled.
- **Solution**: Run `sudo ufw enable` in the terminal.
- **Importance**: Allows only approved traffic and blocks unauthorized access.

### 10. Install and Start X2GO Service *(5 pts)*
- **Issue**: Required software (X2GO) is missing.
- **Solution**: Run `sudo apt-get install x2goserver` to install the service.
- **Importance**: Ensures operational efficiency and supports remote management.

### 11. Disable or Remove Nginx Service *(6 pts)*
- **Issue**: An unnecessary and insecure service is active.
- **Solution**: Run `sudo systemctl stop nginx` and `sudo systemctl disable nginx`.
- **Importance**: Reduces attack surfaces by disabling non-essential services.

### 12. Enable Automatic Update Checks *(6 pts)*
- **Issue**: System is not automatically checking for updates.
- **Solution**: Configure **Software & Updates > Updates** to `Daily`.
- **Importance**: Ensures timely patching of vulnerabilities.

### 13. Update Firefox *(5 pts)*
- **Issue**: Outdated software with known vulnerabilities.
- **Solution**: Use **Software Updater** to update Firefox.
- **Importance**: Protects against exploitations targeting outdated browsers.

### 14. Update Thunderbird *(5 pts)*
- **Issue**: Outdated email client poses a security risk.
- **Solution**: Use **Software Updater** to update Thunderbird.
- **Importance**: Secures communication by patching known issues.

### 15. Remove Prohibited MP3 Files *(6 pts)*
- **Issue**: Non-work-related files present on the system.
- **Solution**: Identify with `locate '*.mp3'` and remove using `sudo rm`.
- **Importance**: Avoids potential exploitation of media viewers and adheres to guidelines.

### 16. Remove Prohibited Software *(AisleRiot – 5 pts)*
- **Issue**: Unauthorized software is installed.
- **Solution**: Run `sudo apt remove aisleriot` and `sudo apt autoremove -y`.
- **Importance**: Reduces risks from unapproved applications.

### 17. Disable Root SSH Login *(6 pts)*
- **Issue**: Root login via SSH is enabled.
- **Solution**: Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to set `PermitRootLogin no`.
- **Importance**: Prevents misuse of superuser privileges.
